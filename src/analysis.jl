"""
    firing_rate_average(P; dt=0.1ms)

Calculates and returns the average firing rates of neurons in a network.

# Arguments:
- `P`: A structure containing neural data, with a key `:fire` in its `records` field which stores spike information for each neuron.
- `dt`: An optional parameter specifying the time interval (default is 0.1ms).

# Returns:
An array of floating point values representing the average firing rate for each neuron.

# Usage:# Notes:
Each row of `P.records[:fire]` represents a neuron, and each column represents a time point. The value in a cell indicates whether that neuron has fired at that time point (non-zero value means it has fired).
The firing rate of a neuron is calculated as the total number of spikes divided by the total time span.

"""
    firing_rate(P, τ; dt=0.1ms)

Calculate the firing rate of neurons.

# Arguments
- `P`: A struct or object containing neuron information, including records of when each neuron fires.
- `τ`: The time window over which to calculate the firing rate.

# Keywords
- `dt`: The time step for calculation (default is 0.1 ms).

# Returns
A 2D array with firing rates. Each row corresponds to a neuron and each column to a time point.

# Note
This function assumes that the firing records in `P` are stored as columns corresponding to different time points. 
The result is normalized by `(dt/1000)` to account for the fact that `dt` is typically in milliseconds.

"""
    spiketimes(P, τ; dt = 0.1ms)

This function takes in the records of a neural population `P` and time constant `τ` to calculate spike times for each neuron.

# Arguments
- `P`: A data structure containing the recorded data of a neuronal population.
- `τ`: A time constant parameter.

# Keyword Arguments
- `dt`: The time step used for the simulation, defaults to 0.1 milliseconds.

# Returns
- `spiketimes`: An object of type `SNN.Spiketimes` which contains the calculated spike times of each neuron.

# Examples
```
julia
spiketimes = spike_times(population_records, time_constant)
```
